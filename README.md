# hotel-system-
This is my hotel system project. This system implemented java and the four main concepts encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, Polymorphism. The aim was to create classes that could hold informartion of differnt entities and interactions the entities communicated to a hotel eg. a guest, 
employee, dates, payments etc. I focused on error handling especially in my datetester class as it was a confusing operation when I was doing my project.
